# VPN Disconnect Troubleshooting Guide

## Fixed Disconnect Issues

The disconnect functionality has been improved with the following fixes:

### 1. Enhanced Disconnect Process

**What was fixed:**

- Added proper VPN service termination
- Improved VPN interface closure
- Added explicit disconnect action handling
- Better resource cleanup

**How it works now:**

1. Sends disconnect action to VPN service
2. Stops the VPN service properly
3. Closes VPN interface immediately
4. Clears all VPN configuration
5. Updates state to DISABLED

### 2. Force Disconnect Feature

Added a **Force Disconnect** button that appears when VPN is connected:

- Use this if normal disconnect fails
- Immediately terminates all VPN resources
- Forces state update to DISABLED

## Testing the Disconnect Functionality

### 1. Normal Disconnect Test

```typescript
// Test normal disconnect
await vpnService.connect(config);
// Wait for CONNECTED state
await vpnService.disconnect();
// Should show DISCONNECTING then DISABLED
```

### 2. Force Disconnect Test

```typescript
// If normal disconnect fails
await vpnService.forceDisconnect();
// Immediately sets state to DISABLED
```

### 3. Monitor Disconnect Process

Check Android logs to see disconnect process:

```bash
adb logcat -s IkeV2VpnService VpnModule
```

You should see logs like:

```
IkeV2VpnService: Received disconnect action
IkeV2VpnService: Stopping VPN thread
IkeV2VpnService: VPN thread stopped successfully
IkeV2VpnService: Closing VPN interface
IkeV2VpnService: VPN interface closed successfully
IkeV2VpnService: IKEv2/IPsec VPN service stopped completely
VpnModule: IKEv2/IPsec VPN disconnected successfully
```

## Usage in React Native

### Using the VpnControl Component

The updated component now includes:

1. **Disconnect Button** - Normal disconnect (blue)
2. **Force Disconnect Button** - Emergency disconnect (orange) - only visible when connected

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import vpnService from './src/services/VpnService';

// Normal disconnect
try {
  await vpnService.disconnect();
  console.log('Disconnected successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Disconnect failed:', error);

  // Try force disconnect
  try {
    await vpnService.forceDisconnect();
    console.log('Force disconnected successfully');
  } catch (forceError) {
    console.error('Force disconnect also failed:', forceError);
  }
}
```

### State Monitoring

Monitor disconnect state changes:

```typescript
vpnService.addStateListener(state => {
  switch (state.state) {
    case 'DISCONNECTING':
      console.log('üîÑ Disconnecting from VPN...');
      break;
    case 'DISABLED':
      console.log('‚úÖ VPN disconnected successfully');
      break;
  }
});
```

## Common Disconnect Issues (Now Fixed)

### ‚ùå Previous Issues:

1. **VPN interface not closing properly**
2. **Service not terminating completely**
3. **State not updating to DISABLED**
4. **Resources not being cleaned up**

### ‚úÖ Current Solutions:

1. **Explicit VPN interface closure with error handling**
2. **Proper service termination with disconnect action**
3. **Immediate state updates with logging**
4. **Complete resource cleanup including configuration**

## Error Handling

The disconnect functionality now handles these errors:

- **VPN_DISCONNECTION_ERROR**: Normal disconnect failed
- **VPN_FORCE_DISCONNECTION_ERROR**: Force disconnect failed
- **Service termination errors**: Logged but don't block disconnect

## Best Practices

1. **Always wait for state updates** before considering disconnect complete
2. **Use force disconnect sparingly** - only when normal disconnect fails
3. **Monitor logs** during testing to ensure proper cleanup
4. **Handle disconnect errors gracefully** in your app

## Debug Commands

Test disconnect functionality:

```bash
# Monitor VPN service logs
adb logcat -s IkeV2VpnService VpnModule

# Check VPN interfaces (should be empty after disconnect)
adb shell ip link show type tun

# Verify no VPN processes running
adb shell ps | grep vpn
```

The disconnect functionality should now work reliably! üéâ
